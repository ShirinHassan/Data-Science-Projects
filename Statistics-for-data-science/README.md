# Statistics-for-data-science

This project has R codes which I have used to analyse data using statistical models and techniques

Topics include: 

Simple linear regression

Multiple linear regression 

Logistic regression 

Prediction using regression models 

Hypoethesis testing 

Correlation

Visualisations (histograms, box plots, corrplots and regression lines) 

The purpose is to teach the user how the models are used and also provide step by step comments 

These codes are useful for those who are learning statistics, R or both and it is the buidling block for statistics in data science and analytics 

Note: I am adding additional codes every week so there will be more code uploaded soon
