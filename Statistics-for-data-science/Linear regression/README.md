Simple regression model: This model explains y in terms of x. 
Examples include: Is there a relationship between working hours and wage? Does sleep affect stress levels? 
Does exercise yield to weight loss? Is there a relationship between years of education and employment rate? 
As you can see from the examples, it is a study of a relationship between the independent variable (x) and the dependant variable (y). 
Simple linear regression model equation: y = b0 + b1x + u. 
Simple linear regression model may not be the best option for ceteris paribus analysis (all other factors remain unchanged). 
It doesnt consider all independant variables which may result in the analysis being limited.
