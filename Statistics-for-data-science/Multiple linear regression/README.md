Multiple regression model: more amenable to ceteris paribus analysis because it enables control for many other factors that affect the dependant variable. 

Includes more than 1 independant variables which makes the analysis more accurate in comparison to simple linear regression model. 
One thing to look out for in independant variables is that they shouldnt have strong correlations between each other. (Multicollinearity issue)
